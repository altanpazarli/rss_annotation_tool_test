Create a RSS annotation tool with the following requirements
============================================================

The idea is to create a simple RSS scraper which saves the feeds to a
database. Users should be able to view the feed and they should be able to annotate it with comments attached to the feed item.

Some functionality which should be there:
=========================================

* User account creation and login
* Support to follow multiple feeds with at least support for the
following ones: 
http://www.nu.nl/rss/Algemeen
https://feeds.feedburner.com/tweakers/mixed
* Ability to add a bookmark/favorite to a feed item.
* Ability to add Markdown based comments to the feed items.
